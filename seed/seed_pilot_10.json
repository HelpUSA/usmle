He received indomethacin earlier for a presumed patent ductus arteriosus.

      "explanation_long": "In transposition of the great arteries (TGA), the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, creating parallel circulations. Survival depends on mixing between these circuits via an atrial septal defect (foramen ovale), ventricular septal defect, or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A restrictive foramen ovale and a constricting ductus severely limit mixing, producing hypoxemia. Indomethacin closes the PDA and therefore worsens mixing in ductal-dependent physiology. The immediate pharmacologic step is prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil) to maintain/reopen the ductus and improve systemic oxygen delivery while awaiting interventions such as balloon atrial septostomy and surgical correction.",
