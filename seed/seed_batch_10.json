He received indomethacin shortly after birth for a presumed patent ductus arteriosus. Echocardiography now demonstrates transposition of the great arteries with a restrictive foramen ovale and a constricting ductus arteriosus. Which fetal circulatory feature best explains the higher preductal saturation, and what is the most appropriate immediate pharmacologic action to improve systemic oxygen delivery?",

      "explanation_long": "In fetal circulation, relatively oxygenated blood from the placenta reaches the right atrium via the inferior vena cava and is preferentially directed across the foramen ovale into the left atrium, then into the left ventricle and ascending aorta—supplying coronary/cerebral circulation and the right upper extremity (preductal). Postductal saturation reflects distal mixing near the ductus. In transposition of the great arteries, systemic and pulmonary circulations run in parallel; survival depends on mixing via the foramen ovale and/or ductus arteriosus. Indomethacin decreases prostaglandins and promotes ductal closure, reducing mixing and worsening hypoxemia. Immediate management is prostaglandin E1 infusion to reopen/maintain the ductus and improve systemic oxygenation while arranging definitive intervention.",
