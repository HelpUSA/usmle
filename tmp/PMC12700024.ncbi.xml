incidence among both sexes is approximately the same. Among all congenital
cardiovascular defects, dextrocardia accounts for no more than 3%<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>There are scarce data on cardiac surgery for dextrocardia<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. In this
report, we present a rare clinical case of surgical treatment of a patient, who had
a congenital anomaly of dextrocardia and a complete transposition of the viscera,
with mitral insufficiency caused by the ruptured chord of the posterior mitral
leaflet. Such heart anatomy contributes to certain challenges in a traditional
setup, which include performing usual surgical &#8220;right-hander&#8217;s&#8221; procedures with the
left hand, adding complexity for a surgeon to approach the mitral valve. In these
settings, the good exposure of the mitral valve is practically unfeasible.
Therefore, the surgery requires special considerations, such as rearranging the
surgical team and equipment in a "mirror-image" setup, including the longer
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) lines, due to the reversed anatomical orientation. All
these listed factors increase the risk of errors associated with the human factor
and related to the activities of the surgeon, the assistant, and the operating
nurse. Therefore, we present our positive experience with operating room and
equipment transformation, which can be reproduced in other clinics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE PRESENTATION</title><p>A 59-year-old male patient was electively admitted to the Cardiac Surgery Department
of the Cardiology Research Institute in January 2024, presenting with complaints of
dyspnea during walking.</p><p>Complete transposition of the viscera was detected in this patient at the age of 12
during a medical examination at school. He had no complaints at that time, was
actively involved in sports, and did not seek medical assistance. Notably, the
patient was the first-born of twins; however, the second twin died at birth due to
an undetermined cause. Upon analyzing the family history, the patient did not recall
any obvious congenital defects among his immediate relatives. Furthermore, his two
children also do not have any congenital anomalies.</p><p>Upon admission to the Cardiac Surgery Department, the physical examination revealed
notable findings: the apical impulse was palpable on the right at the midclavicular
line; the borders of relative cardiac dullness were displaced, with the left border
along the left edge of the sternum, the upper border in the third intercostal space
to the right of the sternum, and the right border along the right midclavicular line
in the fifth intercostal space. Additionally, the liver edge was palpable in the
left hypochondrium.</p><p>Taking dextrocardia into account while recording electrocardiogram (ECG), the
principles of electrode placement were deliberately changed, namely: the red
electrode was placed on the left hand, the yellow one on the right hand. The chest
leads were placed sequentially in a mirror-image position on the right side: V3R,
V4R, V5R, V6R, V1, and V2 were swapped. ECG showed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of
90 bpm, normal electrical cardiac axis, and transition zone at V2-V3 (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>The chest x-ray showed a complete transposition of the viscera. The pulmonary pattern
was deformed due to hilar fibrosis without focal infiltrative changes.</p><p>Transthoracic echocardiography (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) showed
the mirror-imaged arrangement of the studied organs in comparison with the typical
ultrasound image, <italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic>, the left-developed right-sided heart. A
slight left atrial enlargement was detected (52*57 mm in the four-chamber view)
without chamber hypertrophy, with normal left ventricular contractility (left
ventricular ejection fraction in B-mode was 66%). A slightly dilated mitral annulus
(36 mm) was detected; the ruptured chord of the posterior mitral leaflet in P3
segment and grade 2 mitral regurgitation were visualized. The effective regurgitant
orifice was 21 mm. Other valves were functioning normally. The pericardium was not
changed. The performed carotid Doppler sonography showed that the carotid artery
wall was thickened; heterogeneous plaques of up to 10% were detected in carotid
bifurcation, and the internal carotid artery orifices were on both sides.</p><p>

</p><sec><title>Surgical Technique</title><p>The patient underwent invasive coronary angiography showing no signs of coronary
atherosclerosis.</p><p>Thus, based on the preoperative examination, a myxomatous degeneration of the
mitral valve was diagnosed with the ruptured chord of the posterior mitral
leaflet in P3 segment and severe mitral regurgitation against the background of
complete transposition of the viscera.</p><p>When setting out for the upcoming surgery, it was considered reasonable to
perform an additional multislice computed tomography (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> A, B, C, and D).</p><p>

</p><p>Due to dextrocardia and complete transposition of the viscera in the patient,
certain organizational measures were to be taken. During the operation, a
&#8220;mirror inversion&#8221; of the equipment (CPB machine, operating table, screens) and
the position of the surgical team (operating surgeon, assistants, perioperative
nurse) was carried out in the operating room (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> A, B, and C).</p><p>

</p><p>The patient underwent posterior mitral valve leaflet repair and mitral valve
annuloplasty under CPB and antegrade cold cardioplegia. The surgical access was
gained typically via median sternotomy. The special technical feature was that
the aorta and great vessels in the wound were mirrored from the normal position.
Purse string sutures for cannulation of the aorta and vena cava were technically
placed in a standard manner, but the placement itself was in the left parts of
the surgical wound, <italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic>, &#8220;non-standard&#8221; (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>Access to the mitral valve was obtained through atriotomy performed on the left
flank of the surgical wound. After the mitral valve revision and identification
of changes (the fibrous ring was not dilated, the posterior leaflet of the
mitral valve was thickened, the ruptured chord was at P3 segment), posterior
mitral valve leaflet repair was performed. A support C-Ring was inserted in
mitral position. An intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography confirmed
that mitral regurgitation was not observed.</p><p>The postoperative period was uneventful. On day 10 after surgery, the patient was
discharged from the hospital in a satisfactory condition.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The abnormal right-sided location of the heart in the chest was first described by
the Italian anatomist and surgeon Hieronymus Fabricius, in 1606. There are
dextrocardia with situs viscerum inversus totalis - the complete reversal of
internal organs (observed in our patient) - and isolated dextrocardia characterized
by a right thoracic heart with normal locations of the stomach, liver, and
spleen<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. If the normal blood flow in the vessels and
chambers of the heart is maintained, then this cardiac anomaly does not require any
treatment. This is confirmed by the case we describe. The patient, up to 57 years of
age, led an active sports lifestyle. However, the very fact of identifying
dextrocardia in a patient should be an alert for cardiologists in terms of possible
concomitant defects in the development of the heart, systemic dysplasias, which
require dynamic monitoring and regular assessment of intracardiac structures and
possible cardiac complications. For example, myxomatous degeneration of the mitral
valve leaflets, which is described herein, was caused by a congenital defect of
connective tissue<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. The surgical
technique for a patient with dextrocardia is not distinctive, but cardiac surgeons
may encounter technical issues due to the mirror-image transposition of the internal
organs and intracardiac structures. According to Rammos K et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, complications can arise with CPB
connecting because the vena cava and right atrium are located more posteriorly than
normal, and surgeons may be confused by mirror-image findings. Some authors
describing cardiac surgery in dextrocardia and transposition of the internal organs
note the particular nature of surgical interventions in such patients, especially in
such emergency cases as acute aortic dissection<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Additionally, there may be a problem when
performing usual surgical &#8220;right-hander&#8217;s&#8221; procedures with the left hand. Some
authors recommend that the surgeon stand to the left of the patient, which provides
excellent exposure because the patient&#8217;s anatomy is mirror transformed<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Dealing with this rare condition, it is very important for the surgeon to have
spatial abilities in order to better plan the course of the upcoming operation, to
imagine three-dimensional models of the heart, internal organs, and their topography
relative to each other<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, as well as predict possible
risks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The combination of degenerative mitral valve disease with mitral insufficiency and
situs inversus in an adult patient is a rare clinical case. Full awareness of the
cardiac surgery team of dextrocardia in the patient as well as the appropriate
organization of the surgical procedure allowed us to achieve desired immediate
results in radical surgery for valvular heart disease, which ensures clinical
stability in the patient not only at the hospital stage but also in the long-term
postoperative period.</p><p>Our positive experience will be useful for other clinics to apply our scheme
regarding the surgical team&#8217;s new configuration in practice.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Sources of Funding:</bold> The authors declare no external funding to this study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was carried out at the Cardiovascular Surgery Department, Cardiology
